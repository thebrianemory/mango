# Project background
The ecommerce store that we will build is for a fictional brick and motor shop Mango in the city of Auroville. The shop sells fresh vegetables and fruits to its customers directly sourced from nearby farms. Due to popular demand to reduce carbon footprint, Mango has decided to open an online store for its customers. However, it still wants to continue operating the physical shop for customers who prefer to visit the shop. Also the online store only accepts orders from residents of Auroville and delivers to only locations inside Auroville.
